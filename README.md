# Network

The Social Network API is a robust and scalable RESTful API designed for powering social networking applications. Built using Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB with Mongoose, this API provides comprehensive functionality for managing users, thoughts, reactions to thoughts, and friend relationships.

With this API, developers can effortlessly create, read, update, and delete users and their associated content. Users can share their thoughts, react to others' thoughts, and connect with friends. The API ensures data integrity, security, and performance, making it suitable for handling large volumes of unstructured data typical of social media platforms.
